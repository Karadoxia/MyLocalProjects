# Futuristic E‑commerce — Design Brief

This repository contains a small prototype inspired by the provided *FUTURISTIC E-COMMERCE WEBSITE DESIGN BRIEF* (hero, neon accents, immersive micro-interactions).

See `public/index.html`, `public/styles.css`, and `public/app.js` for the demo implementation.

Key elements applied:
- Dark glass-morphism theme with holographic accents
- Large hero typography and call-to-action buttons
- Floating product card with parallax/magnetic interaction
- Product grid with hover elevation and pricing

Next recommended steps:
- Add a component library (React / Solid / Svelte) and a design-system token package
- Integrate animations via Web Animations / Lottie for richer hero
- Add SSR/Prerender + image optimization for performance

Design brief (original) is in the repository history / project conversation.
