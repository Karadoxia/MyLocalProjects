What's needed to reach the goal?\n\n**Step 4: Find Bridges**\nHow can available capabilities provide missing ones?\n\n**Step 5: Build Chain**\nConstruct the composition: phishing \u2192 foothold \u2192 local privesc \u2192 dump creds \u2192 identify DA path \u2192 kerberoast/delegation \u2192 domain admin\n\n**Step 6: Execute and Adapt**\nRun the chain, handle failures, adapt as needed.\n\n### Innovation in Composition\n\nNovel attacks often come from:\n- New combinations of known capabilities\n- Unexpected bridges between capabilities\n- Creative gap-filling\n- Adapting chains to specific targets\n\n### Failure Handling\n\nComposition must handle failures:\n- What if step N fails?\n- Alternative paths available?\n- Fallback capabilities?\n- Detection and retry logic?\n\n### Composition Patterns\n\nCommon composition patterns:\n1. **Linear**: A \u2192 B \u2192 C \u2192 goal\n2. **Parallel**: A + B \u2192 C \u2192 goal\n3. **Conditional**: if A then B else C \u2192 goal\n4. **Iterative**: repeat (A \u2192 B) until C \u2192 goal\n\n### Practice Exercise\n\nGiven your capabilities, compose an attack:\n1. Define an objective beyond current reach\n2. Identify capability gaps\n3. Find bridges to fill gaps\n4. Construct composition\n5. Analyze and refine", "category": "advanced_composition"}
