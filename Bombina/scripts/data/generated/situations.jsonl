{"instruction": "I'm stuck in user context with no privesc vectors", "input": "Seeking guidance for penetration testing situation.", "output": "Explore other hosts with current creds. Check for credential reuse. Look at network services accessible from this host. Check for sensitive files readable by user. Consider password spraying with user's password."}
{"instruction": "Target uses certificate-based authentication", "input": "Seeking guidance for penetration testing situation.", "output": "Capture certificates if possible. Check for ADCS misconfigurations (ESC1-ESC8). Look for certificate theft opportunities. Test for certificate forgery if ADCS is misconfigured."}
{"instruction": "Found a development server", "input": "Seeking guidance for penetration testing situation.", "output": "Development servers often have: weaker security, debug features enabled, default credentials, source code exposure. Prioritize this target - likely easier path to compromise."}
{"instruction": "Client uses a SIEM and I keep triggering alerts", "input": "Seeking guidance for penetration testing situation.", "output": "Slow down testing velocity. Use living-off-the-land techniques. Avoid well-known tool signatures. Test during business hours when noise is higher. Consider if detection is actually part of the test objectives."}
{"instruction": "I have database access but need shell", "input": "Seeking guidance for penetration testing situation.", "output": "Check for: xp_cmdshell (MSSQL), UDF injection (MySQL), copy to/from program (PostgreSQL), Java stored procedures (Oracle). If file write access, try webshell."}
{"instruction": "Password policy requires 20+ characters", "input": "Seeking guidance for penetration testing situation.", "output": "Long passwords are harder to crack but: check for password managers (may store creds), look for password patterns, try pass-the-hash/pass-the-ticket instead, social engineering if in scope."}
{"instruction": "No internet access from compromised host", "input": "Seeking guidance for penetration testing situation.", "output": "Set up relay through initial access point. Use DNS tunneling if DNS works. Exfiltrate data manually. Consider this for evasion - internal-only ops are stealthier."}
{"instruction": "Found credentials in code repository", "input": "Seeking guidance for penetration testing situation.", "output": "Document finding. Check if credentials still valid. Search git history for more. Look for other secrets (API keys, tokens). Common finding with high impact."}
{"instruction": "Target application has rate limiting", "input": "Seeking guidance for penetration testing situation.", "output": "Slow down requests. Distribute across multiple IPs if available. Look for bypass (different endpoints, HTTP methods). Consider if rate limiting prevents exploitation or just slows it."}
{"instruction": "Only finding low/medium severity issues", "input": "Seeking guidance for penetration testing situation.", "output": "Low/medium issues can chain to high impact. Document everything thoroughly. Look for business logic flaws (often not caught by scanners). Sometimes the finding is that security is good - that's valuable too."}
{"instruction": "Need to demonstrate business impact", "input": "Seeking guidance for penetration testing situation.", "output": "Connect technical findings to business risk: data breach potential, financial impact, reputation damage, compliance violations. Use concrete examples: 'attacker could access X customer records'."}
{"instruction": "Client wants me to stop but I'm close to something big", "input": "Seeking guidance for penetration testing situation.", "output": "Stop immediately when asked. Document your progress and the potential path. The client has the right to stop testing at any time. Discuss in debrief what was almost found."}
