{"instruction": "How do I pivot through a compromised host?", "input": "", "output": "Pivoting methods: 1) SSH tunneling: ssh -D 9050 user@pivot for SOCKS proxy. 2) Chisel for HTTP tunnels. 3) Ligolo-ng for more complex scenarios. 4) Metasploit autoroute with route add. 5) ProxyChains through established tunnels."}
{"instruction": "What's the best way to maintain persistence?", "input": "", "output": "Persistence varies by target: Windows - scheduled tasks, registry run keys, services. Linux - cron jobs, ~/.bashrc, systemd services. Web - webshell, modified config files. Use multiple methods for redundancy."}
{"instruction": "How do I avoid AV detection?", "input": "", "output": "AV evasion techniques: 1) Custom compile payloads. 2) Obfuscation tools. 3) Living off the land binaries (LOLBins). 4) In-memory execution. 5) Encrypted payloads with custom decrypters. Test against target AV in lab first."}
{"instruction": "How do I safely test for DoS vulnerabilities?", "input": "", "output": "DoS testing safely: 1) Get explicit written permission. 2) Test during maintenance windows. 3) Start with single requests, increase gradually. 4) Have direct line to ops team. 5) Document everything. 6) Use controlled resource exhaustion."}
{"instruction": "How do I extract data without getting caught?", "input": "", "output": "Stealthy exfil: 1) Slow and low - small chunks over time. 2) Encrypt data before exfil. 3) Use allowed protocols (HTTPS, DNS). 4) Avoid known bad patterns. 5) Consider what's being logged. 6) Data compression."}
{"instruction": "What should I do first after getting initial access?", "input": "", "output": "Initial access checklist: 1) Document how you got in. 2) Stabilize access (persistence if allowed). 3) Enumerate local system. 4) Check privileges. 5) Look for easy escalation paths. 6) Begin internal recon quietly."}
{"instruction": "How do I handle multi-factor authentication?", "input": "", "output": "MFA challenges: 1) Try MFA bypass techniques (token replay, etc). 2) Target systems without MFA. 3) Social engineering (if in scope). 4) Session token theft after auth. 5) Explore admin exceptions. 6) Check for MFA fatigue attack potential."}
{"instruction": "How do I test thick client applications?", "input": "", "output": "Thick client testing: 1) Proxy traffic through Burp. 2) Decompile if possible (Java, .NET). 3) Monitor filesystem/registry. 4) Check for insecure storage. 5) Test client-side validation bypass. 6) Analyze network communication."}
{"instruction": "What's the best approach for API testing?", "input": "", "output": "API testing approach: 1) Map all endpoints (swagger/openapi if available). 2) Test authentication/authorization. 3) Parameter manipulation. 4) Rate limiting checks. 5) Injection points. 6) Business logic flaws. Use Postman/Burp for API-focused testing."}
{"instruction": "How do I document my testing effectively?", "input": "", "output": "Documentation best practices: 1) Real-time notes (CherryTree, Obsidian). 2) Screenshot everything significant. 3) Log all commands (script command on Linux). 4) Timestamp activities. 5) Organize by target/phase. 6) Regular backup of notes."}
