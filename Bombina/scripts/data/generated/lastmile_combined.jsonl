{"instruction": "I'm stuck in user context with no privesc vectors", "input": "Seeking guidance for penetration testing situation.", "output": "Explore other hosts with current creds. Check for credential reuse. Look at network services accessible from this host. Check for sensitive files readable by user. Consider password spraying with user's password."}
{"instruction": "Target uses certificate-based authentication", "input": "Seeking guidance for penetration testing situation.", "output": "Capture certificates if possible. Check for ADCS misconfigurations (ESC1-ESC8). Look for certificate theft opportunities. Test for certificate forgery if ADCS is misconfigured."}
{"instruction": "Found a development server", "input": "Seeking guidance for penetration testing situation.", "output": "Development servers often have: weaker security, debug features enabled, default credentials, source code exposure. Prioritize this target - likely easier path to compromise."}
{"instruction": "Client uses a SIEM and I keep triggering alerts", "input": "Seeking guidance for penetration testing situation.", "output": "Slow down testing velocity. Use living-off-the-land techniques. Avoid well-known tool signatures. Test during business hours when noise is higher. Consider if detection is actually part of the test objectives."}
{"instruction": "I have database access but need shell", "input": "Seeking guidance for penetration testing situation.", "output": "Check for: xp_cmdshell (MSSQL), UDF injection (MySQL), copy to/from program (PostgreSQL), Java stored procedures (Oracle). If file write access, try webshell."}
{"instruction": "Password policy requires 20+ characters", "input": "Seeking guidance for penetration testing situation.", "output": "Long passwords are harder to crack but: check for password managers (may store creds), look for password patterns, try pass-the-hash/pass-the-ticket instead, social engineering if in scope."}
{"instruction": "No internet access from compromised host", "input": "Seeking guidance for penetration testing situation.", "output": "Set up relay through initial access point. Use DNS tunneling if DNS works. Exfiltrate data manually. Consider this for evasion - internal-only ops are stealthier."}
{"instruction": "Found credentials in code repository", "input": "Seeking guidance for penetration testing situation.", "output": "Document finding. Check if credentials still valid. Search git history for more. Look for other secrets (API keys, tokens). Common finding with high impact."}
{"instruction": "Target application has rate limiting", "input": "Seeking guidance for penetration testing situation.", "output": "Slow down requests. Distribute across multiple IPs if available. Look for bypass (different endpoints, HTTP methods). Consider if rate limiting prevents exploitation or just slows it."}
{"instruction": "Only finding low/medium severity issues", "input": "Seeking guidance for penetration testing situation.", "output": "Low/medium issues can chain to high impact. Document everything thoroughly. Look for business logic flaws (often not caught by scanners). Sometimes the finding is that security is good - that's valuable too."}
{"instruction": "Need to demonstrate business impact", "input": "Seeking guidance for penetration testing situation.", "output": "Connect technical findings to business risk: data breach potential, financial impact, reputation damage, compliance violations. Use concrete examples: 'attacker could access X customer records'."}
{"instruction": "Client wants me to stop but I'm close to something big", "input": "Seeking guidance for penetration testing situation.", "output": "Stop immediately when asked. Document your progress and the potential path. The client has the right to stop testing at any time. Discuss in debrief what was almost found."}
{"instruction": "What's the difference between nmap -sS and -sT?", "input": "", "output": "-sS (SYN scan) is stealthier - only sends SYN, doesn't complete handshake. Requires root. -sT (Connect scan) completes full TCP handshake. More reliable but more visible in logs. Use -sS for stealth, -sT when you don't have root."}
{"instruction": "When should I use sqlmap vs manual SQL injection?", "input": "", "output": "Use sqlmap for: automation, complex injections, data extraction. Use manual for: understanding the vulnerability, bypassing WAFs, when sqlmap can't detect it. Best practice: confirm manually first, then use sqlmap for exploitation."}
{"instruction": "Metasploit vs manual exploitation?", "input": "", "output": "Metasploit: faster, reliable, includes post-exploitation. Manual: stealthier, more customizable, better understanding. Use Metasploit for known exploits when speed matters. Manual when stealth is critical or Metasploit module doesn't exist."}
{"instruction": "Pass the Hash vs Pass the Ticket?", "input": "", "output": "Pass the Hash: uses NTLM hash, works with NTLM auth (SMB, etc). Pass the Ticket: uses Kerberos tickets, more versatile in AD environments, can impersonate any user. PtT is generally more powerful in modern AD environments."}
{"instruction": "Responder vs ntlmrelayx?", "input": "", "output": "Responder: captures credentials (hashes) for offline cracking. ntlmrelayx: relays credentials in real-time to other services (no cracking needed). Use Responder when you can crack hashes. Use ntlmrelayx when SMB signing is disabled."}
{"instruction": "Gobuster vs dirsearch vs feroxbuster?", "input": "", "output": "Gobuster: fast, simple, Go-based. dirsearch: Python, more features, recursive by default. feroxbuster: Rust, very fast, smart recursion. For quick scans use gobuster. For thorough enumeration, feroxbuster. dirsearch for compatibility."}
{"instruction": "Burp Suite vs OWASP ZAP?", "input": "", "output": "Burp: industry standard, better extensions, Pro version powerful. ZAP: free/open source, good automation, active development. Use Burp for professional engagements. ZAP is great for learning and when budget is limited."}
{"instruction": "Mimikatz vs secretsdump?", "input": "", "output": "Mimikatz: runs locally on target, more features, Windows only. secretsdump: runs remotely via DRSUAPI, cross-platform. Use Mimikatz for local extraction. secretsdump for remote extraction without deploying tools."}
{"instruction": "CrackMapExec vs Impacket scripts?", "input": "", "output": "CrackMapExec: wrapper around multiple protocols, great for spraying, easy syntax. Impacket: individual tools, more control, scriptable. Use CME for quick enumeration/spraying. Impacket for specific advanced attacks."}
{"instruction": "LinPEAS vs Linux Exploit Suggester?", "input": "", "output": "LinPEAS: comprehensive enumeration, checks many things, colorful output. LES: focused on kernel exploits, suggests specific CVEs. Run LinPEAS first for full picture. Use LES when specifically looking for kernel exploits."}
