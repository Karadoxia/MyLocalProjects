{"instruction": "I have a shell but it keeps dying", "input": "During an authorized penetration test.", "output": "Unstable shells are common. Solutions: 1) Upgrade to a fully interactive TTY (python -c 'import pty;pty.spawn(\"/bin/bash\")'). 2) Set up a more reliable callback mechanism. 3) Add persistence early. 4) Check for monitoring/killing processes."}
{"instruction": "I can't find any vulnerabilities", "input": "During an authorized penetration test.", "output": "Expand your scope: 1) Check all ports thoroughly. 2) Look at application logic flaws. 3) Test authentication thoroughly. 4) Check for default credentials. 5) Review configuration files. 6) Sometimes the path is through users (phishing if in scope)."}
{"instruction": "The exploit requires a specific version but I can't determine it", "input": "During an authorized penetration test.", "output": "Try: 1) Banner grabbing with nmap -sV. 2) Trigger error pages that reveal versions. 3) Check default files (/readme, /version). 4) Look at HTTP headers. 5) Analyze behavior differences between versions."}
{"instruction": "I need to transfer files but no outbound connection", "input": "During an authorized penetration test.", "output": "Options: 1) DNS exfiltration if DNS works. 2) ICMP tunneling if ping works. 3) Write to web directory and fetch via HTTP. 4) Use existing protocols that ARE allowed. 5) Manual transfer via clipboard/screen."}
{"instruction": "Credentials work but can't get shell", "input": "During an authorized penetration test.", "output": "Try: 1) Different protocols (SSH, WinRM, RDP). 2) Impacket tools (wmiexec, smbexec, psexec). 3) Web-based admin panels. 4) Check if credentials work elsewhere. 5) Consider the user may have restricted shell access."}
{"instruction": "Running out of time on engagement", "input": "During an authorized penetration test.", "output": "Prioritize: 1) Focus on highest-risk findings. 2) Document what you have. 3) Set up automated scanning to continue. 4) Communicate with client about limitations. 5) Provide recommendations for future testing."}
{"instruction": "Found sensitive data but not sure if I should touch it", "input": "During an authorized penetration test.", "output": "Document but DON'T exfiltrate: 1) Screenshot showing access (redacted). 2) Count/describe data without viewing details. 3) Note the path taken to access it. 4) Report immediately if it's a critical finding."}
{"instruction": "Target system is very hardened", "input": "During an authorized penetration test.", "output": "Advanced techniques: 1) Look for logic flaws not covered by hardening. 2) Test trust relationships. 3) Check backup systems which may be less hardened. 4) Third-party integrations often have weaknesses. 5) Supply chain attack vectors."}
{"instruction": "My IP got blocked", "input": "During an authorized penetration test.", "output": "Recovery steps: 1) If expected, use backup VPN/IPs. 2) Slow down your testing. 3) Use more targeted scans. 4) Consider if you triggered any false positives. 5) Communicate with client if persistent block."}
{"instruction": "Client asking for live demo of exploit", "input": "During an authorized penetration test.", "output": "Prepare carefully: 1) Test in controlled environment first. 2) Have rollback plan. 3) Document exactly what you'll do. 4) Get written approval for live demo. 5) Have sanitized evidence as backup if live fails."}
