{"instruction": "When should i use nmap vs masscan?", "input": "", "output": "Use masscan for initial fast port discovery across large networks. Use nmap for detailed service/version detection and scripts on discovered ports. They complement each other."}
{"instruction": "When should i pivot vs stay local?", "input": "", "output": "Pivot when: target data is on other systems, you need to reach specific objectives, or current system has limited value. Stay local when: still enumerating, gathering credentials, or establishing persistence."}
{"instruction": "When should i report a finding immediately?", "input": "", "output": "Report immediately if: critical vulnerability found, evidence of prior compromise, sensitive data exposed, or anything that could cause immediate business harm."}
{"instruction": "When should i use authenticated vs unauthenticated scanning?", "input": "", "output": "Start unauthenticated to simulate external attacker. Use authenticated scans for comprehensive view. Authenticated finds more but simulates insider/credentialed attacker."}
{"instruction": "When should i stop testing?", "input": "", "output": "Stop when: scope is exhausted, time is up, client requests stop, you might cause damage, or you've achieved objectives. Always communicate with client."}
{"instruction": "When should i use automated vs manual testing?", "input": "", "output": "Use automated for coverage and finding low-hanging fruit. Manual for: logic flaws, complex vulnerabilities, understanding application behavior. Best results combine both."}
{"instruction": "When should i escalate privileges vs move laterally?", "input": "", "output": "Escalate when: need higher access for current objectives, limited by current privileges. Move laterally when: current system doesn't have what you need, or to find easier escalation paths."}
{"instruction": "When should i use phishing vs technical attacks?", "input": "", "output": "Use phishing when: in scope, perimeter is hardened, or testing user awareness. Technical attacks when: faster path exists, or phishing isn't in scope."}
{"instruction": "When should i use existing tools vs write custom?", "input": "", "output": "Use existing tools for known vulnerabilities and standard techniques. Write custom when: evading detection, unique vulnerability, or specific requirements not met by existing tools."}
{"instruction": "When should i crack hashes vs pass them?", "input": "", "output": "Crack when: you need plaintext (password reuse, policies), or target only accepts plaintext. Pass when: NTLM auth available, faster than cracking, or strong passwords."}
{"instruction": "When should i use metasploit?", "input": "", "output": "Use Metasploit when: exploit module exists, you need post-exploitation features, or quick reliable exploitation. Avoid when: stealth is critical or custom approach needed."}
{"instruction": "When should i use dns exfiltration?", "input": "", "output": "Use DNS exfil when: other outbound traffic blocked, HTTP/HTTPS not available, need slow but reliable data transfer. It's often the last protocol blocked."}
{"instruction": "When should i target domain controllers?", "input": "", "output": "Target DCs when: you have path to reach them, need domain credentials, or seeking domain dominance. They're high-value but also high-risk targets."}
{"instruction": "When should i use proxy tools like burp?", "input": "", "output": "Use Burp/ZAP when: testing web applications, need to intercept/modify requests, or want to analyze traffic. Essential for any serious web app testing."}
{"instruction": "When should i engage with client's security team?", "input": "", "output": "Engage when: testing IDS/SOC response (if in scope), you've been detected and need to continue, or you find evidence of real compromise."}
