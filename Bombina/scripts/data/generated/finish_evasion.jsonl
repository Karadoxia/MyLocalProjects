{"instruction": "How do I avoid antivirus detection during a penetration test?", "input": "", "output": "Methods: custom compiled payloads, obfuscation, encryption, living-off-the-land, process injection, in-memory execution. Test against target AV in lab."}
{"instruction": "How do I bypass application whitelisting during a penetration test?", "input": "", "output": "Use: trusted applications (msiexec, certutil, CMSTP), script hosts (PowerShell, WScript), InstallUtil, regsvr32. Each has different bypass."}
{"instruction": "How do I evade network detection during a penetration test?", "input": "", "output": "Techniques: encrypted channels, legitimate protocols (HTTPS, DNS), timing variations, traffic blending, domain fronting."}
{"instruction": "How do I bypass AMSI during a penetration test?", "input": "", "output": "Patch AMSI in memory, use obfuscation, length bypass, test detections. Multiple public bypasses available, but detected quickly."}
{"instruction": "How do I avoid EDR detection during a penetration test?", "input": "", "output": "Direct syscalls, unhooking, ETW patching, avoiding monitored APIs. Increasingly difficult as EDR improves."}
{"instruction": "How do I disable Windows Defender during a penetration test?", "input": "", "output": "Set-MpPreference -DisableRealtimeMonitoring $true (requires admin). Or exclude paths/processes. May trigger alerts."}
{"instruction": "How do I bypass UAC during a penetration test?", "input": "", "output": "Methods: fodhelper, eventvwr, sdclt. Abuse auto-elevating programs. Many public techniques, but signature varies."}
{"instruction": "How do I hide processes during a penetration test?", "input": "", "output": "Techniques: process hollowing, process doppelganging, direct syscalls. Avoid common process lists and suspicious names."}
{"instruction": "How do I evade logging during a penetration test?", "input": "", "output": "Disable PowerShell logging, clear event logs, timestomping, log rotation abuse. Detection vs evasion tradeoff."}
{"instruction": "How do I traffic tunneling during a penetration test?", "input": "", "output": "Encapsulate C2 in allowed protocols: HTTP, HTTPS, DNS, ICMP. Use legitimate services as proxies."}
{"instruction": "How do I domain fronting during a penetration test?", "input": "", "output": "Route traffic through CDN to hide true destination. Increasingly blocked by providers but still useful."}
{"instruction": "How do I living off the land during a penetration test?", "input": "", "output": "Use legitimate tools: PowerShell, WMI, certutil, bitsadmin, msiexec. No dropped binaries, blend with normal activity."}
{"instruction": "How do I fileless techniques during a penetration test?", "input": "", "output": "Execute entirely in memory. Registry storage, WMI subscription, macro execution. No files on disk to detect."}
{"instruction": "How do I timestamp manipulation during a penetration test?", "input": "", "output": "Modify file timestamps to blend with legitimate files. Use touch or SetFileTime. Helps avoid forensic timeline."}
{"instruction": "How do I log evasion during a penetration test?", "input": "", "output": "Target specific events, clear selectively, modify log settings. Better than clearing all logs which is suspicious."}
