{"instruction": "What's the difference between nmap -sS and -sT?", "input": "", "output": "-sS (SYN scan) is stealthier - only sends SYN, doesn't complete handshake. Requires root. -sT (Connect scan) completes full TCP handshake. More reliable but more visible in logs. Use -sS for stealth, -sT when you don't have root."}
{"instruction": "When should I use sqlmap vs manual SQL injection?", "input": "", "output": "Use sqlmap for: automation, complex injections, data extraction. Use manual for: understanding the vulnerability, bypassing WAFs, when sqlmap can't detect it. Best practice: confirm manually first, then use sqlmap for exploitation."}
{"instruction": "Metasploit vs manual exploitation?", "input": "", "output": "Metasploit: faster, reliable, includes post-exploitation. Manual: stealthier, more customizable, better understanding. Use Metasploit for known exploits when speed matters. Manual when stealth is critical or Metasploit module doesn't exist."}
{"instruction": "Pass the Hash vs Pass the Ticket?", "input": "", "output": "Pass the Hash: uses NTLM hash, works with NTLM auth (SMB, etc). Pass the Ticket: uses Kerberos tickets, more versatile in AD environments, can impersonate any user. PtT is generally more powerful in modern AD environments."}
{"instruction": "Responder vs ntlmrelayx?", "input": "", "output": "Responder: captures credentials (hashes) for offline cracking. ntlmrelayx: relays credentials in real-time to other services (no cracking needed). Use Responder when you can crack hashes. Use ntlmrelayx when SMB signing is disabled."}
{"instruction": "Gobuster vs dirsearch vs feroxbuster?", "input": "", "output": "Gobuster: fast, simple, Go-based. dirsearch: Python, more features, recursive by default. feroxbuster: Rust, very fast, smart recursion. For quick scans use gobuster. For thorough enumeration, feroxbuster. dirsearch for compatibility."}
{"instruction": "Burp Suite vs OWASP ZAP?", "input": "", "output": "Burp: industry standard, better extensions, Pro version powerful. ZAP: free/open source, good automation, active development. Use Burp for professional engagements. ZAP is great for learning and when budget is limited."}
{"instruction": "Mimikatz vs secretsdump?", "input": "", "output": "Mimikatz: runs locally on target, more features, Windows only. secretsdump: runs remotely via DRSUAPI, cross-platform. Use Mimikatz for local extraction. secretsdump for remote extraction without deploying tools."}
{"instruction": "CrackMapExec vs Impacket scripts?", "input": "", "output": "CrackMapExec: wrapper around multiple protocols, great for spraying, easy syntax. Impacket: individual tools, more control, scriptable. Use CME for quick enumeration/spraying. Impacket for specific advanced attacks."}
{"instruction": "LinPEAS vs Linux Exploit Suggester?", "input": "", "output": "LinPEAS: comprehensive enumeration, checks many things, colorful output. LES: focused on kernel exploits, suggests specific CVEs. Run LinPEAS first for full picture. Use LES when specifically looking for kernel exploits."}
