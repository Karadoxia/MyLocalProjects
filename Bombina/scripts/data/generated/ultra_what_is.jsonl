{"instruction": "What is buffer overflow in the context of penetration testing?", "input": "", "output": "Memory corruption vulnerability where data exceeds allocated buffer size, overwriting adjacent memory. Can lead to code execution if attacker controls overwritten data (like return address)."}
{"instruction": "What is race condition in the context of penetration testing?", "input": "", "output": "Bug where outcome depends on timing of events. In security: TOCTOU (time-of-check-time-of-use) allows bypass of checks by changing state between check and use."}

{"instruction": "What is pass the hash in the context of penetration testing?", "input": "", "output": "Authentication technique using password hash instead of plaintext. Works because Windows NTLM auth only needs hash. No password cracking required."}
{"instruction": "What is golden ticket in the context of penetration testing?", "input": "", "output": "Forged Kerberos TGT created with KRBTGT hash. Provides complete domain access, valid for years, survives most password resets. Ultimate AD persistence."}
{"instruction": "What is DNS rebinding in the context of penetration testing?", "input": "", "output": "Attack where DNS record changes IP rapidly. Used to bypass same-origin policy or access internal systems via victim's browser making requests."}
{"instruction": "What is SSRF in the context of penetration testing?", "input": "", "output": "Server-Side Request Forgery - making server make requests to attacker-chosen destinations. Access internal services, cloud metadata, or perform port scanning."}
{"instruction": "What is XXE in the context of penetration testing?", "input": "", "output": "XML External Entity - processing malicious XML that includes external resources. Leads to file read, SSRF, or denial of service."}
{"instruction": "What is deserialization attack in the context of penetration testing?", "input": "", "output": "Exploiting unsafe deserialization of user data. Malicious serialized objects execute code when deserialized by vulnerable applications."}
{"instruction": "What is CSRF in the context of penetration testing?", "input": "", "output": "Cross-Site Request Forgery - tricking authenticated user into performing unwanted actions. Exploits browser's automatic cookie inclusion for requests."}
{"instruction": "What is IDOR in the context of penetration testing?", "input": "", "output": "Insecure Direct Object Reference - accessing resources by manipulating identifiers (user ID, file name). Leads to unauthorized data access."}
{"instruction": "What is clickjacking in the context of penetration testing?", "input": "", "output": "UI redressing attack using invisible iframes. Trick users into clicking hidden elements, performing unintended actions on target site."}
{"instruction": "What is CORS misconfiguration in the context of penetration testing?", "input": "", "output": "Cross-Origin Resource Sharing allowing unintended origins to access resources. Can lead to sensitive data exposure from authenticated contexts."}
{"instruction": "What is subdomain takeover in the context of penetration testing?", "input": "", "output": "Claiming abandoned subdomains pointing to decommissioned services. The DNS record exists but the service doesn't, allowing attacker registration."}
{"instruction": "What is kerberoasting in the context of penetration testing?", "input": "", "output": "Requesting service tickets for accounts with SPNs, then cracking offline. Targets service accounts with weak passwords. No special privileges needed."}
{"instruction": "What is AS-REP roasting in the context of penetration testing?", "input": "", "output": "Targeting accounts without Kerberos pre-authentication. Request AS-REP, crack offline. Similar to Kerberoasting but different mechanism."}
{"instruction": "What is credential stuffing in the context of penetration testing?", "input": "", "output": "Using breached credentials from other sites. Relies on password reuse. Different from brute force - uses known valid credentials."}
{"instruction": "What is DNS tunneling in the context of penetration testing?", "input": "", "output": "Encoding data in DNS queries/responses to bypass firewalls. Slow but often works when other protocols are blocked. Used for C2 or exfiltration."}
{"instruction": "What is living off the land in the context of penetration testing?", "input": "", "output": "Using legitimate system tools for malicious purposes. Avoids dropping custom binaries. Examples: PowerShell, WMI, certutil, bitsadmin."}
{"instruction": "What is C2 framework in the context of penetration testing?", "input": "", "output": "Command and Control infrastructure for managing compromised hosts. Examples: Cobalt Strike, Metasploit, Empire. Provides payload generation, comms, post-exploitation."}
{"instruction": "What is webshell in the context of penetration testing?", "input": "", "output": "Malicious script uploaded to web server providing remote access. Usually simple: accepts commands, returns output. Persistent backdoor access."}
{"instruction": "What is reverse shell in the context of penetration testing?", "input": "", "output": "Connection from victim to attacker (outbound), bypassing inbound firewall rules. Attacker listens, victim connects back with shell access."}
{"instruction": "What is bind shell in the context of penetration testing?", "input": "", "output": "Shell listening on victim's port for attacker connection. Requires inbound access, easier to detect. Less common than reverse shells."}
{"instruction": "What is payload in the context of penetration testing?", "input": "", "output": "Code or commands delivered during exploitation. Can be shellcode, scripts, or full agents. Chosen based on target OS, constraints, and objectives."}
{"instruction": "What is persistence in the context of penetration testing?", "input": "", "output": "Maintaining access across reboots or credential changes. Methods: scheduled tasks, registry keys, services, implants, backdoor accounts."}
{"instruction": "What is pivoting in the context of penetration testing?", "input": "", "output": "Using compromised host to access otherwise unreachable networks. Essential for internal assessments. Implements through tunnels or proxies."}
{"instruction": "What is foothold in the context of penetration testing?", "input": "", "output": "Initial access to target network. Usually single compromised system. Starting point for lateral movement and privilege escalation."}
