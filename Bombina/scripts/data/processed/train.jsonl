Assume standard enterprise security controls are in place.", "output": "Technique overview: Adversaries may use a hidden file system to conceal malicious activity from users and security tools. File systems provide a structure to store and access data from physical storage. Typically, a user engages with a file system through applications that allow them to access files and directories, which are an abstraction from their physical location (ex: disk sector). Standard file systems include FAT, NTFS, ext4, and APFS. File systems can also contain other structures, such as the Volume Boot Record (VBR) and Master File Table (MFT) in NTFS. Adversaries may use their own abstracted file system, separate from the standard file system present on the infected system.

Conditional access policies are additional verifications used by identity providers and identity and access management systems to determine whether a user should be granted access to a resource. For example, in Entra ID, Okta, and JumpCloud, users can be denied access to applications based on their IP address, device enrollment status, and use of multi-factor authentication. In some cases, identity providers may also support the use of risk-based metrics to deny sign-ins based on a variety of indicators. In AWS and GCP, IAM policies can contain attributes that verify arbitrary constraints such as the source IP, the date the request was made, and the nature of the resources or  This technique serves the credential-access, defense-evasion, persistence phase(s).

When used maliciously, LKMs can be a type of kernel-mode Rootkit that run with the highest operating system privilege (Ring 0). Common features of LKM based rootkits include: hiding itself, selective hiding of files, processes and network activity, as well as log tampering, providing authenticated backdoors, and enabling root access to non-privileged users.

Pass the hash (PtH) is a method of authenticating as a user without having access to the user's cleartext password. This method bypasses standard authentication steps that require a cleartext password, moving directly into the portion of the authentication that uses the password hash. When performing PtH, valid password hashes for the account being used are captured using a Credential Access technique. Captured hashes are used with PtH to authenticate as that user. Once authenticated, PtH may be used to perform actions on local or remote systems. Adversaries may also use stolen password hashes to \"overpass the hash.\" Similar to PtH, this involves us This technique serves the defense-evasion, lateral-movement phase(s).

Once adversaries have gained access to a network by either compromising an account lacking MFA or by employing an MFA bypass method such as Multi-Factor Authentication Request Generation, adversaries may leverage their access to modify or completely disable MFA defenses. This can be accomplished by abusing legitimate features, such as excluding users from Azure AD Conditional Access Policies, registering a new yet vulnerable/adversary-controlled MFA method, or by manually patching MFA programs and configuration files to bypass expected functionality. For example, modifying the Windows hosts file () to redirect MFA calls to localhost instead of an MFA server ma This technique serves the credential-access, defense-evasion, persistence phase(s).

DLLs are libraries that contain code and data that can be simultaneously utilized by multiple programs. While DLLs are not malicious by nature, they can be abused through mechanisms such as side-loading, hijacking search order, and phantom DLL hijacking. Specific ways DLLs are abused by adversaries include: ### DLL Sideloading Adversaries may execute their own malicious payloads by side-loading DLLs. Side-loading involves hijacking which DLL a program loads by planting and then invoking a legitimate application that executes their payload(s). Side-loading positions both the victim application and malicious payload(s) alongside each other.

In order to move laterally from a compromised host, adversaries may take advantage of trust relationships established with other systems via public key authentication in active SSH sessions by hijacking an existing connection to another system. This may occur through compromising the SSH agent itself or by having access to the agent's socket. If an adversary is able to obtain root access, then hijacking SSH sessions is likely trivial.

Assume standard enterprise security controls are in place.", "output": "Technique overview: Adversaries may acquire user credentials from third-party password managers. Password managers are applications designed to store user credentials, normally in an encrypted database. Credentials are typically accessible after a user provides a master password that unlocks the database. After the database is unlocked, these credentials may be copied to memory. These databases can be stored as files on disk. Adversaries may acquire user credentials from password managers by extracting the master password and/or plain-text credentials from memory. Adversaries may extract credentials from memory via Exploitation for Credential Access. Adversaries may also try brute forcing via Password Guessing to obtain the master password of a password manager. This technique serves the credential-access phase(s).

Binary padding effectively changes the checksum of the file and can also be used to avoid hash-based blocklists and static anti-virus signatures. The padding used is commonly generated by a function to create junk data and then appended to the end or applied to sections of malware.

To enable a port, an adversary sends a series of attempted connections to a predefined sequence of closed ports.

This technique has been observed both for the dynamic opening of a listening port as well as the initiating of a connection to a listening server on a different system. The observation of the signal packets to trigger the communication can be conducted through different methods. One means, originally implemented by Cd00r , is to use the libpcap libraries to sniff for the packets in question.

For example, an adversary with sufficient permissions may create a RoleBinding or a ClusterRoleBinding to bind a Role or ClusterRole to a Kubernetes account. Where attribute-based access control (ABAC) is in use, an adversary with sufficient permissions may modify a Kubernetes ABAC policy to give the target account additional permissions. This account modification may immediately follow Create Account or other malicious account activity. Adversaries may also modify existing Valid Accounts that they have compromised.

Traffic signaling involves the use of a magic value or sequence that must be sent to a system to trigger a special response, such as opening a closed port or executing a malicious task. This may take the form of sending a series of packets with certain characteristics before a port will be opened that the adversary can use for command and control. Usually this series of packets consists of attempted connections to a predefined sequence of closed ports (i.e. Port Knocking), but can involve unusual flags, specific strings, or other unique characteristics. After the sequence is completed, opening a port may be accomplished by the host-based firewall, but could This technique serves the defense-evasion, persistence, command-and-control phase(s).

DLL injection is a method of executing arbitrary code in the address space of a separate live process. DLL injection is commonly performed by writing the path to a DLL in the virtual address space of the target process before loading the DLL by invoking a new thread. The write can be performed with native Windows API calls such as <code>VirtualAllocEx</code> and <code>WriteProcessMemory</code>, then invoked with <code>CreateRemoteThread</code> (which calls the <code>LoadLibrary</code> API responsible for loading the DLL).

Changes could be disabling the entire mechanism as well as adding, deleting, or modifying particular rules. This can be done numerous ways depending on the operating system, including via command-line, editing Windows Registry keys, and Windows Control Panel. Modifying or disabling a system firewall may enable adversary C2 communications, lateral movement, and/or data exfiltration that would otherwise not be allowed. For example, adversaries may add a new firewall rule for a well-known protocol (such as RDP) using a non-traditional and potentially less securitized port (i.e. Non-Standard Port).

{"instruction": "Analyze the use of External Proxy technique in a penetration test.", "input": "Target environment: ESXi, Linux, Network Devices, Windows, macOS. Attack phase: command-and-control. Assume standard enterprise security controls are in place.", "output": "Technique overview: Adversaries may use an external proxy to act as an intermediary for network communications to a command and control server to avoid direct connections to their infrastructure. Many tools exist that enable traffic redirection through proxies or port redirection, including HTRAN, ZXProxy, and ZXPortMap. Adversaries use these types of proxies to manage command and control communications, to provide resiliency in the face of connection loss, or to ride over existing trusted communications paths to avoid suspicion. External connection proxies are used to mask the destination of C2 traffic and are typically implemented with port redirectors. Compromised systems outside of the victim environment may be used for these purposes, as well as purchased infrastructure such as cloud-based resources or v This technique serves the command-and-control phase(s). Consider sequencing with complementary techniques for a complete attack chain."}
{"instruction": "Your attempt at Azure Resource Manager Role Assignment in Azure failed due to insufficient permissions.", "input": "Need to find alternative escalation path. What do you check next?", "output": "When Microsoft.Authorization/roleAssignments/write fails, enumerate alternative paths: 1) Check for other high-privilege applications/service principals. 2) Look for group memberships that might provide indirect access. 3) Review custom roles for overlooked permissions. 4) Check PIM (Privileged Identity Management) for eligible role activations. The original technique (Azure Resource Manager Role Assignment) failing suggests monitoring may be in place - adjust operational tempo."}

Reasons for Defacement include delivering messaging, intimidation, or claiming (possibly false) credit for an intrusion. Disturbing or offensive images may be used as a part of Defacement in order to cause user discomfort, or to pressure compliance with accompanying messages. This technique serves the impact phase(s). Consider sequencing with complementary techniques for a complete attack chain."}
{"instruction": "What defenses effectively prevent NTLM relay?", "input": "Hardening systems against attacks like those performed by impacket.", "output": "Defense in depth against NTLM relay: 1) Prevention - input validation, least privilege, patching. 2) Detection - high risk attacks are detectable through network and endpoint monitoring. 3) Response - automated blocking, alert escalation, playbooks. 4) Recovery - backups, incident response plan. Specific mitigations for impacket: rate limiting defeats automated scanning, CAPTCHA prevents brute force, strong authentication. Defense should assume motivated attackers will find alternatives - focus on detection and response alongside prevention."}
{"instruction": "Evaluate the attack path: Lambda Function Privilege Escalation in AWS.", "input": "Available technique: lambda:CreateFunction + iam:PassRole. What are the tradeoffs?", "output": "Attack analysis for Lambda Function Privilege Escalation: With lambda:CreateFunction and iam:PassRole, create a Lambda function that assumes a higher-privileged role. The function executes with the attached role's permissions. Detection risk: Medium - Lambda creation is logged but may not trigger alerts in dev environments. Key insight: Target roles with overly permissive trust policies that allow Lambda service principal. Check for roles with 'lambda.amazonaws.com' in trust policy.... Key decision factors: detection likelihood, permission requirements, and persistence value. Always enumerate current permissions before attempting privilege escalation."}
