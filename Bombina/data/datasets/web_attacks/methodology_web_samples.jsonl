What's the approach?", "output": "Test authentication mechanisms for weaknesses. Authentication is often the first barrier to application access. Test for default credentials first - they're common and non-destructive. Password spraying avoids lockouts by testing few passwords across many accounts.

{"instruction": "When and how should you use Authorization Testing (IDOR) in a penetration test?", "input": "Planning the web attacks phase. What's the approach?", "output": "Test for insecure direct object references. Authorization flaws are extremely common because they require custom implementation for each application. Testing involves changing IDs in requests to access other users' data. Numeric IDs are easiest to enumerate; UUIDs are harder but not immune. Always test with multiple user roles. Automated tools can help but manual testing catches logic flaws. Key techniques include: Parameter manipulation, Forced browsing, Horizontal privilege escalation. Recommended tools: Burp Suite, Autorize extension."}

{"instruction": "When and how should you use Injection Testing in a penetration test?", "input": "Planning the web attacks phase. What's the approach?", "output": "Test for various injection vulnerabilities. Injection vulnerabilities occur when user input is incorporated into commands or queries without proper sanitization. Each injection type has specific syntax - understand the backend technology. Error-based techniques provide immediate feedback; blind techniques require inference. Second-order injection stores payloads for later execution in different contexts. Key techniques include: SQL injection, NoSQL injection, Command injection. Recommended tools: sqlmap, Burp Suite, custom payloads."}
