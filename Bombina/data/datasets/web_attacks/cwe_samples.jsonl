Out-of-bounds write vulnerabilities allow attackers to corrupt memory, potentially leading to code execution. In penetration testing, these are high-value targets in binary exploitation. Detection is difficult without source code access, but fuzzing and memory analysis tools can identify them. Exploitation requires understanding of memory layout and often bypassing protections like ASLR and stack canaries."}

XSS is prevalent because developers often trust user input or fail to properly encode output. Testing involves injecting script payloads into all input vectors. Reflected XSS requires social engineering for exploitation, while stored XSS persists and affects all users viewing the content. DOM-based XSS requires analyzing client-side JavaScript. Impact ranges from session hijacking to complete account takeover."}

SQL injection remains common despite decades of awareness because developers still concatenate user input into queries. Testing involves identifying injection points and determining database type. Blind SQLi requires boolean or time-based techniques when output is not visible. Union-based attacks extract data directly. The goal progression is: detect > identify DBMS > enumerate > extract data > potentially achieve code execution via xp_cmdshell or similar."}

Use-after-free vulnerabilities are complex to exploit but powerful when successful. They occur when memory is accessed after being deallocated. Exploitation involves controlling what gets allocated in the freed memory region. Modern browsers and applications are common targets. Heap grooming techniques are essential for reliable exploitation. These bugs often lead to remote code execution in browser and kernel contexts."}

Input validation failures underlie many other vulnerability classes. Testing involves sending unexpected data types, lengths, formats, and encodings. Edge cases like null bytes, unicode normalization issues, and type confusion are valuable attack vectors. Defense requires both syntactic validation (format) and semantic validation (business logic). Client-side validation alone is never sufficient."}
