Need to continue testing but avoid escalation.", "output": "When impacket is detected due to traffic flagged: 1) Pause and assess - don't repeat failed actions. 2) Analyze why - examine responses/logs for clues. 3) Alternative approaches: crackmapexec, Rubeus. 4) Technique variations: different timing, encoding, or methodology. 5) If detected, coordinate with client per ROE - may need to pause. Recovery strategy depends on engagement type - red team has more flexibility than standard pentest. Document the block for the report."}

Need to continue testing but avoid escalation.", "output": "When bloodhound is blocked due to IPS dropping packets: 1) Pause and assess - don't repeat failed actions. 2) Analyze why - examine responses/logs for clues. 3) Alternative approaches: PowerView, ADRecon. 4) Technique variations: different timing, encoding, or methodology. 5) If detected, coordinate with client per ROE - may need to pause. Recovery strategy depends on engagement type - red team has more flexibility than standard pentest. Document the block for the report."}

Need to continue testing but avoid escalation.", "output": "When crackmapexec is failed due to wrong version: 1) Pause and assess - don't repeat failed actions. 2) Analyze why - examine responses/logs for clues. 3) Alternative approaches: smbclient, impacket. 4) Technique variations: different timing, encoding, or methodology. 5) If detected, coordinate with client per ROE - may need to pause.

{"instruction": "Exploit attempt failed - rate limiting triggered. What's your analysis?", "input": "Used hashcat for initial attempt. Target seems hardened.", "output": "Failure analysis for rate limiting triggered: 1) Version mismatch - confirm target version matches exploit requirements. 2) Configuration differences - target may have non-default settings. 3) Security controls - rate limiting triggered suggests active defense. 4) Technique noise - hashcat has offline detection risk. Next steps: manual verification of vulnerability, alternative exploitation path, or pivot to different attack vector. Failure information is valuable - document defensive capabilities observed."}

Recovery strategy depends on engagement type - red team has more flexibility than standard pentest. Document the block for the report."}
{"instruction": "Exploit attempt failed - rate limiting triggered. What's your analysis?", "input": "Used nuclei for initial attempt. Target seems hardened.", "output": "Failure analysis for rate limiting triggered: 1) Version mismatch - confirm target version matches exploit requirements. 2) Configuration differences - target may have non-default settings. 3) Security controls - rate limiting triggered suggests active defense. 4) Technique noise - nuclei has medium-high detection risk. Next steps: manual verification of vulnerability, alternative exploitation path, or pivot to different attack vector. Failure information is valuable - document defensive capabilities observed."}
