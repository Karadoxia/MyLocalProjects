{"instruction": "Analyze why this attack failed and suggest alternatives.", "input": "Attempted Kerberoasting but got no results. Domain environment confirmed.", "output": "Kerberoasting failure analysis: 1) No SPNs exist - rare but possible in small environments. 2) All service accounts are managed service accounts (gMSA) with strong passwords. 3) Insufficient permissions - need authenticated domain user. 4) Query scope too narrow - try different LDAP filters. 5) Tool misconfiguration - verify domain controller connectivity. Alternative approaches: ASREPRoasting (doesn't require SPNs), enumerate ACLs for write permissions, look for password in SYSVOL/GPP, check for certificate template misconfigurations (ADCS). Verification: Run LDAP query manually - '(&(servicePrincipalName=*)(!(objectCategory=computer)))'. If zero results, SPNs genuinely don't exist - shift to other AD attack vectors."}
{"instruction": "Attack failed - analyze and provide alternatives.", "input": "Responder captured NTLMv2 hash but cracking failed after 2 days with rockyou + rules.", "output": "Hash cracking failure analysis: Password is likely: 1) Longer than 12 characters. 2) Contains uncommon patterns. 3) Uses passphrase format. 4) Randomly generated. Alternative approaches instead of cracking: 1) NTLM relay - relay the hash to another service (SMB signing disabled?). 2) Capture additional hashes from different users - may find weaker password. 3) Pass-the-hash if NTLMv1 downgrade possible. 4) Targeted wordlist - company name, location, sports teams, seasons+year. 5) Check if user is Kerberoastable - different hash format might crack faster. Recommended: Attempt NTLM relay before more cracking. If SMB signing enabled, try LDAP relay for resource-based constrained delegation. The hash itself has value beyond cracking."}
{"instruction": "Exploit failed - troubleshoot.", "input": "MS17-010 scan shows vulnerable but exploit fails with 'target is not vulnerable' error.", "output": "MS17-010 false positive analysis: 1) Named pipes not accessible - exploit needs specific pipes (samr, netlogon, lsarpc). 2) SMB version mismatch - some exploits only work on specific SMB dialects. 3) Null session required but not available. 4) Memory corruption already occurred from previous attempt - target may be unstable. 5) Architecture mismatch - x86 vs x64 exploit. Troubleshooting: Verify with nmap --script smb-vuln-ms17-010. Try different exploit implementations (AutoBlue, Metasploit, manual). Check SMB dialect with smbclient. If pipes blocked: May indicate partial patching or firewall rules. Alternatives: Try other SMB vulns (CVE-2020-0796 SMBGhost) or shift to credential-based access."}
{"instruction": "Social engineering attack failed.", "input": "Phishing campaign sent to 50 users. Zero clicks after 24 hours. Good pretext used.", "output": "Phishing failure analysis: 1) Email didn't reach inbox - check if domain is blacklisted, SPF/DKIM/DMARC failing. 2) Email security gateway blocked payload/link - try different hosting, obfuscation. 3) Pretext wasn't compelling enough - review against target demographics. 4) Timing wrong - sent during off-hours, busy period, or holidays. 5) Link looks suspicious - URL reputation, typosquatted domain obvious. 6) Training awareness high - users may be reporting instead of clicking. Investigation: Check if any emails bounced, use canary tokens to verify delivery. Alternatives: 1) Callback phishing (phone-based). 2) Direct phone pretext. 3) Physical attack vector (USB drops). 4) Target different user group (new employees, contractors). Consider: 24 hours may be too short - some users check email infrequently."}
{"instruction": "Container escape failed - analyze.", "input": "Tried cgroup escape but notify_on_release is 0 and cannot be changed. Not privileged container.", "output": "Non-privileged container escape options are limited. Analysis: 1) cgroup escape requires write access to cgroup fs - blocked in unprivileged. 2) Check what capabilities ARE granted: cat /proc/self/status | grep Cap. 3) Look for kernel vulnerabilities specific to kernel version. 4) Check for mounted sensitive paths (/var/run/docker.sock, /etc/, host volumes). 5) Container may be misconfigured without being 'privileged'. Alternative approaches: 1) Exploit application to reach other containers in same network. 2) Look for secrets in environment variables for cloud/external access. 3) Kubernetes-specific: Check for service account token with cluster permissions. 4) Break out via application vulnerability to host service. If truly locked down: Container may not be the path - focus on what the container CAN access (databases, APIs, internal services)."}
