{"instruction": "You are conducting an external pentest against a corporate network.", "input": "Target has web application on port 443, email gateway, VPN portal. No credentials yet. WAF detected.", "output": "Priority reconnaissance: 1) Subdomain enumeration to find shadow IT or forgotten assets not behind WAF. 2) Email address harvesting for potential password spraying against VPN/OWA. 3) Technology fingerprinting on web app to identify framework-specific vulnerabilities. Avoid direct WAF probing initially - focus on information gathering. Risk assessment: Password spraying has medium detection risk if lockout policies exist. Subdomain enum is low risk. Next step: Run amass/subfinder, then check for default creds on discovered assets."}
{"instruction": "You are performing initial access assessment on a target organization.", "input": "Client uses Microsoft 365, Azure AD, has public-facing Jenkins server. MFA enabled on email.", "output": "Jenkins is highest priority - often misconfigured with weak/default credentials or exposed script console. Check for /script endpoint, anonymous read access, and CVE-2024-23897 (file read). M365 with MFA makes password spraying less effective but not impossible - check for legacy auth protocols that bypass MFA. Azure AD: enumerate users via Teams/OneDrive presence, look for guest access misconfigurations. Recommended path: Jenkins exploitation > Azure AD enumeration > targeted phishing with adversary-in-the-middle if Jenkins fails. Detection risk: Jenkins probing is medium (logs requests), Azure enum is low."}
{"instruction": "Plan initial access for an assumed breach engagement.", "input": "You have a low-privilege Windows 10 workstation on corporate network. EDR (CrowdStrike) deployed. No admin rights.", "output": "Assumed breach with EDR present requires careful approach. Immediate goals: 1) Situational awareness without triggering EDR - use built-in tools (net, nltest, systeminfo) rather than offensive tooling. 2) Identify network segments reachable from this host. 3) Map AD structure using ADExplorer or native LDAP queries. Avoid: Running Mimikatz, suspicious PowerShell, or touching LSASS - CrowdStrike will catch these. Instead: Look for saved credentials in browsers, credential manager, or configuration files. Check for Kerberoastable accounts. Recommended: LDAP enumeration > Kerberoasting > credential harvesting from files. Keep dwell time low on initial recon."}
{"instruction": "You need initial access to a small business network.", "input": "Target has single public IP, running pfSense firewall, internal Windows network. Budget target - likely limited security tooling.", "output": "Small business profile suggests: 1) Weaker password policies 2) Outdated software 3) Limited monitoring. Attack priorities: Check pfSense for known CVEs and default credentials (admin/pfsense). Scan for exposed services - RDP, SMB, or admin panels forwarded through firewall. If web presence exists, test for basic SQLi/auth bypass. Social engineering via phone is often effective against small businesses. Recommended approach: Service enumeration > credential guessing > phishing if technical attacks fail. Detection risk: Very low - unlikely to have SIEM or active monitoring. Caution: Small attack surface means limited entry points - may need patience."}
{"instruction": "Assess initial access vectors for a healthcare organization.", "input": "Hospital network with PACS systems, EMR (Epic), medical IoT devices. HIPAA compliant environment.", "output": "Healthcare environments have unique attack surface. High-value targets: 1) PACS/DICOM systems - often unpatched, weak authentication, and contain PHI. 2) Medical IoT - legacy devices with hardcoded credentials. 3) Vendor VPN access - third-party maintenance often has persistent access. Avoid: Disrupting patient care systems - ethical and legal red line. EMR systems like Epic are well-hardened - not the best initial target. Recommended approach: Identify vendor connections and legacy medical devices. These are typically the weakest links. Detection considerations: Healthcare often has compliance logging but weak active monitoring. HIPAA violations are severe - document scope carefully."}
