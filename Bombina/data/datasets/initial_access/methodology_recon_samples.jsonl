{"instruction": "When and how should you use Passive DNS Enumeration in a penetration test?", "input": "Planning the initial access phase. What's the approach?", "output": "Gather DNS information without direct target interaction. Passive recon provides attack surface information without alerting the target. Certificate Transparency logs reveal all SSL certificates issued for a domain, exposing subdomains. Historical DNS can show decommissioned but still-resolving hosts. This intelligence shapes active testing priorities. Key techniques include: Historical DNS records, Certificate Transparency logs, Subdomain enumeration via passive sources. Recommended tools: SecurityTrails, crt.sh, DNSDumpster."}

What's the approach?", "output": "Gather information about people and organization for social engineering. Human factors often present the easiest path into an organization. Understanding reporting structures identifies high-value targets. Email patterns enable credential stuffing and phishing. Technology stack knowledge helps craft convincing pretexts. OSINT should precede any social engineering attempts. Key techniques include: LinkedIn scraping, Email pattern discovery, Organizational structure mapping. Recommended tools: theHarvester, LinkedIn, Hunter.io."}

{"instruction": "When and how should you use Network Mapping in a penetration test?", "input": "Planning the initial access phase. What's the approach?", "output": "Identify live hosts, open ports, and network topology. Network mapping reveals the attack surface. Different scanning techniques trade stealth for speed - SYN scans are faster, connect scans are more reliable through firewalls. Service versions identify potential vulnerabilities. OS detection helps select appropriate exploits. Scan timing affects both detection probability and accuracy. Key techniques include: Host discovery, Port scanning, Service enumeration. Recommended tools: nmap, masscan, Shodan."}
