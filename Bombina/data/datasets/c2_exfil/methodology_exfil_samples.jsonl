What's the approach?", "output": "Prepare and transfer data out of target environment. Exfiltration must balance speed, stealth, and reliability. Compress data to reduce transfer size and time. Encrypt to prevent content inspection. Chunk large datasets to avoid triggering size-based alerts. Protocol selection: HTTPS blends with normal traffic, DNS is rarely blocked but slow, ICMP tunneling is unusual. DLP systems monitor for sensitive patterns - avoid obvious data. Key techniques include: Compression, Encryption, Chunking. Recommended tools: tar, 7z, openssl."}

Protocol selection: HTTPS blends with normal traffic, DNS is rarely blocked but slow, ICMP tunneling is unusual. DLP systems monitor for sensitive patterns - avoid obvious data. The key techniques (Compression, Encryption, Chunking, Protocol tunneling) each serve different scenarios. Success requires understanding both the technique and the target environment."}

What's the approach?", "output": "Exfiltrate data through non-standard channels. When standard channels are blocked or monitored, alternatives exist. DNS tunneling encodes data in DNS queries - rarely blocked. ICMP carries data in ping packets. Steganography hides data in images. Legitimate cloud services (Google Drive, Dropbox) are often whitelisted. Each method has bandwidth and reliability tradeoffs. Key techniques include: DNS tunneling, ICMP tunneling, Steganography.
