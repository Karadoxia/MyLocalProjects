What's the approach?", "output": "Authenticate using NTLM hash without knowing password. NTLM authentication accepts hashes directly - no need to crack. Captured hashes from LSASS, SAM, or network relay can authenticate to other systems where the account has access. PTH works across the domain for domain accounts. Restricted Admin mode enables PTH over RDP. Detection: unusual logon events, lateral account usage. Key techniques include: SMB PTH, WMI PTH, RDP restricted admin PTH.

What's the approach?", "output": "Abuse Kerberos protocol for lateral movement. Kerberos tickets prove identity to services. Captured TGT (pass-the-ticket) provides domain access. Overpass-the-hash requests TGT using NTLM hash. Golden ticket forges TGT with krbtgt hash - complete domain compromise. Silver ticket forges service tickets - targeted access.

What's the approach?", "output": "Execute commands on remote systems. Multiple protocols enable remote command execution with appropriate credentials. PSExec requires SMB and admin shares - creates service, highly detectable. WMI uses DCOM - less visible but slower. WinRM is legitimate admin protocol - blends in.
